user state gets filled in redux and works great but when i moved to another page, it is showing logged in but user is null

how i found the issue cleared local and session storage and it logged out showing the option to log in again

solution save the user data to localstorage not only redux as it moves to its initial  stage when the app is refreshed thus loosing data. 
user: localStorage.getItem("user")
    ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"))
    : null,
learnt what is the use of localstorarge
